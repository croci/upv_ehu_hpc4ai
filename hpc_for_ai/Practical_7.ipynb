    "## Question 1 - Finding what I need in the MPI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question you will learn how to use the mpi4py documentation. Your taks is to open the [mpi4py docs](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and see whether you can find a list of all possible communication functions. Once you find the list, choose $2$-$3$ functions and click on them: it will show you the syntax for calling them and what they return. Finally, for each of these functions, open the official [MPI docs](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) and search for their syntax in the doc pdf. Alternatively, you can google \"MPI parallel FUNCTION_NAME\" and you will likely find useful results. Note that typically all MPI info is provided in either C/C++ or Fortran syntax, but it should be easy enough to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** In the `mpi4py` docs you do not need to click on search. Remember that communication functions are member functions of the Communicator class, which is part of the `mpi4py.MPI` module, which you can find under \"Contents\" (the menu on the left in the documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Remembering all MPI functions by heart is difficult if you do not use them often. I typically open the list of available functions and their documentation to remind myself."

    "## Random number generation in a parallel environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Random numbers are used ubiquitously in AI:\n",
    "* Before training. Initialisation of neural network biases and weights requires random numbers.\n",
    "* During training. Some applications require selecting a random batch for stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "* As part of the method, e.g., if you work with Gaussian mixture models or stochastic processes.\n",
    "In a parallel environment there is an additional complication arising when generating random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer-generated random numbers are not random**\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, note that random numbers are generated on your computer by a specific class of software called random number generators (RNGs). Numbers sampled from RNGs are not really random (non-quantum computers typically work deterministically so they cannot generate truly random sequences): they are only pseudo-random, a term which indicates that they are actually deterministic, yet carefully designed to behave as closely as possible like actual random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generators and random seeds**\n",
    "\n",
    "RNGs are typically initialised with a *seed* that defines the initial *state* of the generator. From this initial state, RNGs generate a pseudo-random sequence which depends on the method used. All these sequences are typically periodic and have a *period* which indicates after how many numbers the sequence will repeat itself. The period is typically very large, e.g., $2^{128}$. Specifying a seed is very important for results reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why you need to be careful with MPI and RNGs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes the problem with MPI: each process will have their own indentical copy of every variable including the initial RNG state, which means that every rank will typically have the same RNG generating the same exact numbers. This is a big issue since the generated numbers will be correlated, which is very bad for whatever method based on independent samples!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible generic solutions (software-dependent)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skipahead.** This is the safest option. Some sequences allow to skip a chunk of numbers. This can be exploited by having each rank access the same sequence from a diffent initial state so that the generated numbers never overlap (provided the period is large enough and that the ranks are not too many this is typically the safest option).\n",
    "* **Change seed.** Potentially unsafe (software-dependent), but typically fine. This is not the optimal solution, but it is often good enough. If the RNG is initialised with a different seed for each rank, then the generated numbers are likely to be uncorrelated (but not guaranteed, hence why the other method is to be preferred).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific `numpy.random` solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy team has thought long and hard about random number generation and the `numpy.random` module is now quite advanced. However, one needs to be aware and know how to use these functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Do not use `numpy.random.rand` and `numpy.random.randn` functions when using MPI. These are not supposed to be used in a parallel environment.\n",
