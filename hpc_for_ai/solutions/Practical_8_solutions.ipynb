    "**Hint 1:** Always run the above code to select the GPUs to use. If you get weird memory errors, then restart the kernel (the circular arrow above) and run the GPU selection code again. To check a cupy array current device, use `myarray.device` (it will return the GPU number). In Practical 1 we saw how we move an array from the CPU to the GPU by using `cp.asarray`. This function can also be used to move data to another GPU, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Make sure to keep track of where arrays live in memory!!!\n",
    "with cp.cuda.Device(0):\n",
    "    x_gpu_0 = cp.ndarray([1, 2, 3])  # create an array in GPU 0\n",
    "\n",
    "with cp.cuda.Device(1):\n",
    "    x_gpu_1 = cp.asarray(x_gpu_0)  # move the array to GPU 1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** I recommend using `with cp.cuda.Device(deviceID):` to ensure computations are actually done with device number `deviceID` and not with another one. What I mean is to use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def matmul(aa,bb):\n",
    "    with cp.cuda.Device(aa.device): # It becomes superslow if I do not do this.\n",
    "        return aa@bb\n",
    "```\n",
    "I do not know why this `with` is needed, but it seems like it will otherwise trigger some memory movement to and from devices which is slow. I feel like this is caused by trying to use multiple devices so it may be that doing it this way is not a good way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** To time each operation, put it into a function and use `cupyx.profiler.benchmark`, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from cupyx.profiler import benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_func(a):\n",
    "    return cp.sqrt(cp.sum(a**2, axis=-1))\n",
    "\n",
    "a = cp.random.random((256, 1024))\n",
    "print(benchmark(my_func, (a,), n_repeat=128, devices=(a.device,)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that benchmark will output the time spent by both CPU and GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 4:** It is always veery good practice to use variable names which help reminding you where is the variable stored in memory (e.g., use `_h` for host, `_d` for device)."

    "## Tutorial 1 - An overview of CuPy kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will learn a bit about how to write your own kernels in CuPy. It is good to be aware of these although my personal opinion is that they are not that great. Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can always use CuPy built-in numpy-like functions without having to write any kernels.\n",
    "* CuPy kernel writing functionalities are many, but most are limited and poorly documented.\n",
    "* I am not sure I would recommend using CuPy kernels unless you use the Raw CUDA kernels (see below) or you are trying to do something simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more, see the [official CuPy docs](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/user_guide/kernel.html#).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible CuPy Kernel writing strategies with my personal comments\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Elementwise and reduction kernels (poor documentation)**. These let you write and JIT your own kernels using a simplified syntax. However, the set of allowed operations and syntax is poorly documented. There is some mention of having to use CUDA C/C++ fragments. Very unclear so I would skip this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kernel fusion (limited, but easy)**. This option is easy to use, yet its functionality is limited. CuPy provides a decorator, `cupy.fuse` which you can use to turn a set of CuPy operations into a single kernel which will then be JIT-ed and should then run faster. For instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cupy as cp\n",
    "@cp.fuse\n",
    "def myfun(x, y):\n",
    "    return cp.sin(x - y)*x + cp.exp(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, important operations such as `matmul` are unsupported. Worth keeping in mind, but not great.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Raw Kernels (Powerful, but requires C/C++)**. This option lets you write your own CUDA C/C++ kernels which will then be JITed so that you can pass cupy arrays into it. This is an easy option for wrapping CUDA code into Python and it is powerful since you can wrap whatever you want. However, it requires knowing how to write CUDA C/C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JIT Rawkernels (Perhaps a good compromise)**. This option is similar to the way numba works. CuPy provides a JIT decorator - `cupyx.jit.rawkernel` - which can be used like `numba.jit` to turn a Python function into a CUDA kernel which is then JIT-ed. The good thing is that doing so allows the user to write CUDA-like code without ever leaving Python and that CuPy maths functions can be used. The problem is that documentation is poor, array operations are unsupported, and the functionality is marked as experimental.\n",
